# EV Charging Station Route Optimization Application
## Project Description

The goal of the EV Charging Station Route Optimization Application is to increase user convenience when driving an electric vehicle (EV) by analyzing the distances between different charging station locations. This application helps users find efficient routes for their vehicles by selecting a starting location within a 23-node network, determining the fastest path to each charging station, and recommending the best route.
