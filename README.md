# EV Charging Station Route Optimization Application
## Project Description

The goal of the EV Charging Station Route Optimization Application is to increase user convenience when driving an electric vehicle (EV) by analyzing the distances between different charging station locations. This application helps users find efficient routes for their vehicles by selecting a starting location within a 23-node network, determining the fastest path to each charging station, and recommending the best route.



## Set Up and Execution
Requirements

- Python 3.x
- matplotlib
- networkx
- tkinter
- csv

Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Sabrina-OT/AlgorithmsFinal.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```
    cd AlgorithmsFinal
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    - Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your machine.
    - Install the required libraries using pip:

    ```
    pip install matplotlib networkx
    ```

    ```
    # For Python 3.x
    pip install tkinter
    ```

    ```
    # No additional installation is needed for csv module as it's a part of Python's standard library.
    ```

Usage

1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

2. Run the main Python script:

    ```
    python FinalProject.py
    ```

3. Enter the starting node in the textbox provided in the GUI and press Enter.

4. The graph will be visualized, and the shortest paths from the starting node to specified nodes will be displayed within the application.

File Structure

- `FinalProject.py`: Main Python script to run the application.
- `network_data.csv`: CSV file containing the graph data.
- `README.md`: Instructions and information about the project.
